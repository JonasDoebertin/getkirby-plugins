This plugin will rewrite all URLs to assets, files in the content folder and thumbnails to direct to a CDN. 

#### Setup 

1. Copy the cdn folder into site/plugins
2. Add the following config options to site/config/config.php

```php
c::set('cdn.assets', 'http://cdn.mydomain.com');
c::set('cdn.content', 'http://cdn.mydomain.com');
c::set('cdn.thumbs', 'http://cdn.mydomain.com');
```

That's it! Make sure you have a CDN at that url at all :) and it either has all the assets you are linking to uploaded, or it is setup as a pullzone.

You can switch off parts of it by simply passing false or not setting it: 

```php
c::set('cdn.thumbs', false);
```

Or you can of course use different CDNs or subdomains:

```php
c::set('cdn.assets', 'http://assets.mycdn.com');
c::set('cdn.content', 'http://content.mycdn.com');
c::set('cdn.thumbs', 'http://thumbs.mycdn.com');
```

#### Cachebusting

In addition to the CDN plugin you might want to check out the (link: /plugin/cachebuster text: cachebuster plugin) to help you with cachebusting for CSS or JS files in order to avoid issues with cached assets after updates. 

#### Beware with thumbs!

Enabling the CDN option for thumbnails might easily eat up your storage limit on your CDN unless your assets automatically expire after a certain time, because old thumbnails won't be deleted automatically. 

#### Tested

This plugin has so far only been tested with (link: http://keycdn.com text: keycdn.com). Please let me know if you run into any issues with other CDNs and feel free to submit improvements.
